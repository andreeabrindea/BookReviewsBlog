# The Book's Heit



### This is supposed to be a blog for a friend of mine which is passionate about literature and writing. I wanted to make this site just for her, in a way that she wants to, so ehe can use it to write her own reviews for the books she reads.

#### This should be the home page:

#### I added a page for register, because we thought that it will be nice if there are some users which can give comments/suggestions:
